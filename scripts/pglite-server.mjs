// The local development database: one PGlite instance (embedded Postgres, WASM —
// nothing to install) exposed on a TCP port via the Postgres wire protocol.
//
// Everything else connects as an ordinary Postgres client, which is what makes
// dev safe: PGlite is a single Postgres over a data directory, and `next dev`
// alone runs app code in two processes (the server and a route worker). Opening
// the directory from several processes would give each its own isolated — and
// mutually corrupting — view, so exactly this process owns it.
//
// Started automatically by `npm run dev` (scripts/with-local-db.mjs); run it
// directly (`npm run db:serve`) to keep the DB up for drizzle-kit studio or psql.
